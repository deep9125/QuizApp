  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list of VideoDetail asset objects, each describing a font file and its
  # properties. For example:
  fonts: # <-- Make sure this 'fonts:' is indented under 'flutter:'
    - family: Aboreto # <-- This is the name you'll use in your Dart code
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Aboreto-Regular.ttf # <-- Path to your font file
        # If you have different weights/styles (e.g., Bold, Italic), add them here:
        # - asset: assets/fonts/Aboreto-Bold.ttf
        #   weight: 700
        # - asset: assets/fonts/Aboreto-Italic.ttf
        #   style: italic
